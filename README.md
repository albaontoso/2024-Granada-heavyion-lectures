# Heavy-ion lectures

Material connected with the "Estudio de la materia en condiciones extremas: del cosmos a los aceleradores de part√≠culas" lectures in the Physics MSc program, Granada 2024. See https://masteres.ugr.es/fisica/docencia/seminarios for more details. 

## Material for lectures
-[](cuestionario.pdf/): short quiz to evaluate the students (in spanish).

-[Slides](Slides/): this folder contains the four lectures presented during the course. 

-[npdfs](npdfs.py/): simple python script to plot nuclear PDFs using the EPPS21 set (EPJC 82 (2022) 5, 413). It requires the LHAPDF library (https://lhapdf.hepforge.org).

-[mc-glauber](mc-glauber.ipynb/): Jupyter notebook that generates Glauber initial conditions for a heavy-ion collision and compute a few relevant quantities such as the eccentricities. For more advanced examples, see 
https://github.com/MCGlauber/MCG, https://cholmcc.gitlab.io/nbi-python/mechanics/Glauber.html or https://github.com/jbernhard/glauber-model. 

-[toy-shower](toy-shower.ipynb/): Jupyter notebook that generates an oversimplified parton shower including some transverse momentum broadening. Largely based on https://github.com/gavinsalam/zuoz2016-toy-shower
